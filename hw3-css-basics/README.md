# hw3-css-basics

In this assignment, you may find CSS much trickier than HTML on its own. However, you will also begin to experience the thrill of designing your semantically meaningful content, since both languages work together to create a cohesive and meaningful web design project. 

In HW3, you will practice CSS basics, such as the following:

- Linking a `.css` stylesheet to your HTML file, so your CSS code can change the block and inline element behaviors.
- The difference between *class* and *ID* attributes
- Different types of CSS *selection* to target HTML elements, and
- *Inheritence* and *specificity*.

## Instructions

1. Copy the available `hw3-copy` folder and add your lastname to it in all lowercase as follows:
  - `hw3-lindgren`
2. Follow the prompts within the `hw3.html` file and in the below 'HW3 Instructions' section.
3. To submit it, open your Github Desktop app.
  - **NOTE**: Submit your work on Monday, even if you complete it before Monday.
4. Review and Commit the changes to the `gh-pages` branch.
5. Push your work to the shared repo on Github.
  - **NOTE**: You may need to "Fetch" changes, since others will be submitting their files. Desktop should prompt you to do so, if needed.
