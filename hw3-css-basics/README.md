# hw3-css-basics

In this assignment, you may find CSS much trickier than HTML on its own. Both languages work together to create a cohesive and meaningful web design project. In it, you will practice basics such as the following:

- Linking a `.css` stylesheet to your HTML file, so your CSS code can change the block and inline element behaviors.
- The difference between *class* and *ID* attributes
- Different types of CSS selection, and
- Inheritence and specificity.

## Instructions

1. Copy the available hw3 folder and add your lastname to it in all lowercase as follows:
  - `hw3-lindgren`
2. Follow the prompts within the `hw3.html` file.
  - NOTE: You will need to create a `.css` of your own.
3. To submit it, open your Github Desktop app.
  - **NOTE**: Submit your work on Monday, even if you complete it before Monday.
4. Review and Commit the changes to the `gh-pages` branch.
5. Push your work to the shared repo on Github.
  - **NOTE**: You may need to "Fetch" changes, since others will be submitting their files. Desktop should prompt you to do so, if needed.
