1. Using your code editor, add your own MarkDown (.md) file with your lastname as the filename in all lowercase.
   - Mine would be named 'lindgren.md'.
2. Markup some simple content with some simple `HTML`. (HTML also works in markdown files.)
   - This is <strong>bolded text</strong>.
   - This is <em>emphasized text</em>.
3. Save it in your code editor.
4. Open your Github Desktop app.
5. Review and Commit the changes to the gh-pages branch.
6. Push your work to the shared repo on Github.
   - **NOTE**: You may need to "Fetch" changes, since others will be submitting their files. Desktop should prompt you to do so, if needed.
